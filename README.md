# What is this repo?

The purpose of this repo is to demo a better Github workflow structure for SFL Github repo.

This is in regards to [Aha! Proposal 117](https://sunflower-land.ideas.aha.io/ideas/SFL-I-117).

# Repository Tour

1. Go to repo's **"Issues"** and open a new issue. See different templates available.
2. Go to repo's **"Projects"** and see project board with a demo'd feature request. Also read notes in lanes.

# Notes from ShiningMinions

- I currently have **"Change Requests"** and **"Feature Requests"** as two different types of issues. I'm contemplating reducing this to just **"Feature Requests"** for simplicity.
- GreenTeam (coreDevs) should be the only ones having write-access the Github Projects board.
- There should be automations (github actions) in place to automatically move issues across the projects board. See notes cards in projects.
- At some point, we should also talk about possibly creating a second Github projects board. This board will be a mirror'd version, but for community to review features against GreenTeam (coreDevs).
